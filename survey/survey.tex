\FloatBarrier


The general architecture of edge computing typically consists of three main hierarchical layers designed to efficiently manage data generation, processing, and analysis tasks. These layers are interconnected and cooperate closely to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness.


\subsubsection{Site Plant (Data Generation Layer)}\

\vspace{0.2cm}
Edge devices represent the initial stage in the architecture, composed mainly of endpoints such as IoT sensors, actuators, smartphones, surveillance cameras, drones, wearable devices, and autonomous vehicles. These devices continuously generate data through their embedded sensors and are capable of basic local data preprocessing or filtering tasks. Their primary functions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Capturing real-time data from the physical environment.
    \item Performing simple preprocessing operations (e.g., noise reduction, data aggregation).
    \item Initial data validation and basic local decisions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Edge Layer (Local Processing Layer)}\
\vspace{0.2cm}

Edge nodes are intermediate computing points located near edge devices, enabling localized data processing, efficient resource utilization, and reduced latency. These nodes bridge the gap between edge devices and cloud infrastructure, ensuring seamless data flow and intelligent decision-making. Positioned strategically close to data sources, they handle tasks such as advanced data filtering, aggregation, real-time analytics, and temporary data storage, reducing the need for constant cloud communication and minimizing network bandwidth consumption. Additionally, they serve as intermediaries that manage interactions between edge devices and cloud services, optimizing overall system performance. 

Several key components define the edge node layer. The \textbf{edge gateway} plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between edge devices and the cloud by handling protocol translation, network security, and initial data processing. It aggregates data from multiple sources, filtering redundant information and ensuring efficient transmission. Complementing this, the \textbf{edge controller} is responsible for real-time monitoring and automation, overseeing critical device-level operations such as industrial control systems, robotics, and smart infrastructure. By executing predefined logic, edge controllers enable immediate responses without relying on centralized processing.  

For more demanding computational tasks, the \textbf{edge cloud} functions as a localized micro data center, providing storage, processing power, and AI/ML capabilities closer to the source. This environment supports virtualization, distributed computing, and real-time analytics while ensuring low-latency execution. At the foundational level, \textbf{edge sensors} act as the primary data-generating components, capturing real-world information such as temperature, motion, video, and biometric data. Smart sensors with embedded processing capabilities can perform preliminary computations, such as anomaly detection and signal preprocessing, reducing unnecessary data transmission and improving efficiency.  

By leveraging these interconnected components, the local processing layer significantly enhances computational efficiency, ensures real-time analytics, and strengthens security by managing sensitive data closer to its origin.


\subsubsection{Cloud Layer (Centralized Processing Layer)}\

\vspace{0.2cm}
Despite the strong local processing capabilities provided by edge nodes, some complex and resource-intensive analytical tasks still require central cloud resources. The hybrid architecture integrates edge nodes with traditional centralized cloud services to perform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deep learning, big data analytics, and extensive computational tasks.
    \item Centralized long-term data storage and historical data analysis.
    \item Global optimization and resource management.
    \item Comprehensive system management, updates, and coordination.
\end{itemize}

This integration ensures scalability, flexibility, and optimized resource allocation, combining the advantages of both centralized and decentralized computing models.

\subsubsection{Communication and Networking}
Communication within an edge computing architecture relies on a mix of wired and wireless protocols adapted to specific scenarios, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LoRa. Network communication is optimized for low latency, high reliability, and secure data exchange, ensuring efficient and seamless interoperability across all layers.



\subsection{Difference with Centralized Cloud Computing}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{IMG/5.png}
    \caption{Main differences between cloud computing and edge computing}
    \label{fig:cloud_vs_edge}
    \end{figure}
    \FloatBarrier



\subsubsection{Architectural Differences}
Centralized cloud computing utilizes a single or few data centers to handle all data processing and storage tasks. All data generated by end-users or devices is transmitted over the internet to these remote data centers for analysis and storage. In contrast, edge computing adopts a decentralized architecture, distributing computational resources close to the points of data generation. This distribution allows edge computing to handle data processing directly at the local nodes or devices.

\subsubsection{Latency and Real-Time Responsiveness}
In centralized cloud computing, latency is inherently high due to the distance between end-users and data centers, typically ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds, which can severely impact applications requiring immediate feedback. Edge computing significantly reduces latency by processing data locally, often achieving response times of only a few milliseconds, ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and real-time industrial monitoring.

\subsubsection{Bandwidth Utilization}
Centralized cloud computing often requires transmitting large volumes of data continuously, leading to substantial bandwidth consumption and network congestion. Conversely, edge computing processes most data locally and transmits only essential or aggregated information to the central cloud. This localized processing significantly reduces bandwidth usage and alleviates network loads.

\subsubsection{Data Security and Privacy}
Centralized cloud computing involves frequent transmission of data over public networks, increasing exposure to potential security breaches and data leaks. Edge computing enhances data security by reducing data transfers and handling sensitive information locally. Consequently, this approach minimizes the risks associated with network interception and centralized data breaches.

\subsubsection{Reliability and Fault Tolerance}
Reliability in centralized cloud computing heavily depends on the continuous availability of network connections and central servers, making services vulnerable to network disruptions or data center outages. Edge computing provides greater resilience due to its decentralized nature, enabling continuous operation of local systems even during external network disruptions, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.

\subsubsection{Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impact}
Centralized cloud infrastructures consume significant energy for data transmission, processing, and cooling systems in large data centers. Edge computing reduces energy consumption by limiting the transmission and central storage of massive data sets. By processing data locally, edge computing contributes to lower overall energy consumption and a reduced environmental footprint.



\subsection{Classifications of Edge Computing}
Edge computing can be categorized into three primary classifications: \textbf{Fog Computing, Cloudlets, and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)}. These classifications differ in their architecture, use cases, and deployment models while collectively serving to enhance computing performance, reduce latency, and optimize data management at the network's edge.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{IMG/1.png}
    \caption{Classifications of edge computing}
    \label{fig:edge_classifications}
    \end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Fog Computing:}
Fog computing extends the capabilities of traditional cloud computing by bringing computational resources closer to the devices that generate the data. Positioned as an intermediary layer between cloud data centers and edge devices, fog computing enables faster processing and alleviates the burden on the network by handling data locally, closer to the point of generation.

One of the standout characteristics of fog computing is its ability to decentralize data processing. Instead of routing all data to a central data center, it allows for distributed computing across various network layers, such as gateways, routers, and local servers. This hierarchical structure helps reduce latency, as data is processed closer to its source, ensuring faster responses. Moreover, because sensitive data can be analyzed locally rather than sent over the internet, fog computing enhances security and privacy. This decentralized nature also lends itself well to large-scale IoT applications, where numerous devices need to generate and process data in real-time.

When compared to traditional cloud computing, fog computing’s distributed processing model offers advantages in scalability, particularly in IoT ecosystems. Unlike Cloudlets, which focus on single, high-performance micro-data centers, fog computing operates across multiple layers, offering a broader, more flexible solution.

\subsubsection{Cloudlets:}
Cloudlets represent small-scale, localized data centers designed to serve end-users with low-latency computing. Typically deployed in environments like hospitals, campuses, or office buildings, cloudlets offer high-performance computing closer to users, ensuring a seamless experience for applications that demand significant computational power.

While fog computing decentralizes processing across multiple layers, cloudlets focus on a single, localized high-performance micro-data center. This makes them ideal for resource-intensive applications, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and AI-based analytics. Cloudlets are also distinct in that they can function independently from the central cloud. Even if network connectivity is lost, cloudlets can continue to operate autonomously, ensuring uninterrupted service for critical applications.

Compared to Fog Computing, cloudlets are more self-contained, offering direct cloud-like services at the edge. They do not require multiple intermediate nodes like fog computing does, instead delivering localized processing for applications that require minimal latency. Additionally, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) differs from cloudlets in that MEC is tightly integrated with mobile network infrastructures, supporting mobile connectivity rather than general-purpose edge computing.

    \end{figure}
\FloatBarrier


Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) brings edge computing capabilities directly into mobile networks by placing computational resources at cellular base stations or at the network's edge. MEC has become a crucial enabler for 5G networks, where it supports ultra-low-latency applications that are vital for emerging technologies, such as connected vehicles, smart cities, and real-time AI analytics.

MEC stands apart from traditional cloud computing by processing data closer to its source, at the edge of the mobile network. This ensures that data does not need to travel long distances to centralized servers, dramatically reducing latency and improving real-time response. MEC is optimized for 5G networks and is particularly well-suited for handling the vast volumes of data generated by IoT devices. For example, in autonomous driving, MEC enables vehicles to make decisions almost instantaneously, without relying on cloud-based systems.

Furthermore, by offloading processing to the edge, MEC also helps optimize bandwidth usage in mobile networks. This reduces the strain on cellular infrastructure, ensuring smoother service delivery for real-time services. MEC is therefore ideal for applications that require immediate feedback, such as remote surgeries, smart city management, and industrial automation.

What sets MEC apart from the other models is its deep integration with mobile networks. While Fog Computing and Cloudlets offer decentralized solutions, MEC is specifically designed to work within cellular environments, enhancing mobile connectivity and optimizing performance for latency-sensitive applications.

\noindent\textit{Edge Advantage:} By limiting unnecessary data transmission and enabling localized computing, edge systems reduce energy usage and improve operational efficiency. In IoT-based agriculture or smart building systems, edge devices can autonomously process sensor data, reducing dependency on energy-intensive cloud servers.

\bigskip

\noindent In summary, edge computing acts as a practical and scalable response to the limitations of centralized cloud computing. By enhancing latency, security, bandwidth, and resilience, edge technologies extend the reach and capability of the cloud, particularly for applications requiring local intelligence, real-time responsiveness, and high data autonomy.
